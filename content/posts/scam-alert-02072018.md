- Watch out for social media accounts that ask for donations as part of fake promotions by posing as prominent figures in the crypto space
- Watch out for false posts on Reddit saying that wallets or exchanges are shutting down and they need donations, we pointed out one on the Electrum wallet Reddit page the other day
- Note: We will never shill any referral links on this channel nor will we ever ask for donations, if you see anyone posing as us - DM us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/crypto_chasers) and let us know!
