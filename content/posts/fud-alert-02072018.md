Mainstream media is at it again as well as many other news outlets spreading fud - after taking a slight break attacking cryptocurrencies on Tuesday - news outlets such as CNBC are releasing headlines such as, "Most cryptocurrencies will crash to zero, Goldman Sachs says" other recent articles point out the recent hacks of Ethereum and how "devs don't know what to do" also releasing articles like "This NFL player lost money in Bitcoin and now he is listening to Warren Buffett" despite the recent price rises there will always be FUD being released - although not all of it is FUD, there are certainly many more positive articles popping up. As always we encourage our readers to not be swayed by these articles into doing impulsive trades and always to keep an objective perspective on the market.
