This week marks a very positive week as multiple payment processors have announced support for Litecoin. There is much interest in the [LitePay](https://www.litepay.us) payment platform similar to [BitPay](https://bitpay.com) but without the 5% fees. LitePay is expected to launch on February 26th, 2018.

[Aliant Payments](https://twitter.com/AliantPayment) the most recent to add Litecoin to their payment processor is a large credit card processing & merchant services provider - it is one of the first to cryptocurrency solutions (BTC, LTC, ETH) for merchants.

Below is a tweet by Charlie in regards to the payment processors planning on supporting Litecoin:

## Growing number of lightning network nodes

The number of growing mainnet nodes is also a very positive thing for both Bitcoin and Litecoin. The [lightning network](https://lightning.network) is a sidechain solution which enables instant transactions, scalability, and low costs.

As of this writing there are currently 587 mainnet lightning network nodes and 1469 channels, you can view data regarding the lightning network on this [lightning node explorer](https://lnmainnet.rompert.com).

## Release of Litecoin Core 0.15.1rc1

Release of Litecoin Core 0.15.1 release candidate 1 on February 7th has been very positive and has a number of performance changes. Litecoin's release of the release candidate shows that the final version of Litecoin Core 0.15.1 is almost ready to go.

## Concluding thoughts and why we're very optimistic on Litecoin's future

With the addition of more vendors and the 0 fee LitePay card, the bull case for Litecoin is looking very good. We're optimistic in regards to Litecoin's long term future based on the sole reason that the fundamentals are getting stronger everyday. We're excited to see further adoption of the lightning network and eventually the adoption of [atomic swaps](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-are-atomic-swaps/) as well as the ability to write smart contracts based on Litecoin.
